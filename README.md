# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- This project is about finding the variables which are significant in predicting rentals for shared bikes.
- This project is on US bike-sharing provider BookBikes
- In this project, i am using linear regression to find predictive variables to increase shared bike rentals
- CSV file(Common-separated values)


## Conclusions
- It was observed feel-like temparate (atemp), and windspeed are predictor variable for bike rentals.
- Based on day of week, it was observed "monday" have high bike rentals
- Based on month of the year - August and September seems more favorable for bike rentals
- Based on season - 'summer' and 'winter' are favorable for bike rentals
- Based on weather situation - 
	Sunny (Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy) & 
	Light Rain (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds)
	are favorable season for bike rentals
- Working days are also predictive variable for bike rentals
